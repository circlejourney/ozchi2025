<h2 id="ws-3">3. The Role of XR, Spatial, and Physical Interaction in Remote Multimodal Communication: Emotional
	Well-Being in Older Adults (Half day, Saturday morning)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As society ages and family structures evolve, older adults increasingly rely on&nbsp;remote social interactions.
	Traditional methods like video calls and messaging&nbsp;often inadequately support emotional expression, cognitive
	engagement, and&nbsp;sustained participation among this group. Extended Reality (XR) offers&nbsp;promising
	multimodal interaction opportunities through spatial presence,&nbsp;gestures, and haptic feedback. However, existing
	XR platforms often overlook&nbsp;the unique preferences, abilities, and challenges faced by older adults.
	This&nbsp;workshop invites participants to critically reflect upon and co-design multimodal&nbsp;XR communication
	experiences, using scenarios such as remotely celebrating&nbsp;holidays, to enhance older adults&rsquo; emotional
	well-being and social connectedness.</p>

<h2 id="ws-5">5. Robots in the wild: Methodological Exploration of Robots in Everyday Environments (Half day, Saturday
	morning)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Robots are increasingly part of our streets, campuses, hospitals, and cities. As these&nbsp;systems leave the lab and
	become embedded in public life, how do we make sense&nbsp;of their interactions, roles, and impacts? This half-day
	workshop invites scholars and&nbsp;practitioners from across disciplines to reflect on how we study robots in the
	wild.&nbsp;Through short participant presentations, a keynote, and a card-based collaborative&nbsp;mapping activity,
	we will chart the current methodological landscape, surface shared&nbsp;challenges, and co-develop future directions
	for interdisciplinary research on public&nbsp;robotics.</p>

<h2 id="ws-6">6. Moving Together with Robotics : A workshop on Co-embodied Human-Robot Interaction to Inspire Movement
	(Half day, Saturday afternoon)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This movement-based human&ndash;robot interaction (HRI) workshop invites participants to reimagine&nbsp;the shapes,
	forms, and movements of human and nonhuman entities through the lens of&nbsp;Performative Experience Design (PED).
	Framing HRI as a more-than-human encounter, the&nbsp;workshop explores robotic appendages as dynamic bodily
	extensions through co-embodied&nbsp;movement practices. Employing speculative prototyping and embodied exploration,
	participants&nbsp;are prompted to reconceptualize robotics through movement, materiality, and
	performativity.&nbsp;Combining brainstorming and bodystorming, the workshop investigates the interplay
	between&nbsp;human and nonhuman affordances in coexisting human&ndash;robot scenarios, opening new pathways&nbsp;for
	understanding robotic appearance, behavior, and meaning-making beyond both&nbsp;anthropocentric and
	non-anthropocentric paradigms.</p>

<h2 id="ws-7">7. Engaging human and non-human perspectives in crisis resilience: Designing AI-supported Immersive
	Technologies for Inclusive Decision-Making (Half day, Saturday afternoon)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>How can we design technologies that support inclusive planning in times of crisis - accounting not&nbsp;only for
	human needs, but also for ecological systems and non-human lives? This half-day&nbsp;workshop invites researchers
	and practitioners to explore how immersive and AI-supported tools&nbsp;might reshape participatory engagement for
	crisis resilience. Through collaborative mapping,&nbsp;discussion, and speculative design, we will examine current
	challenges and co-develop new&nbsp;interaction concepts that reflect multispecies perspectives. Participants from
	HCI, design, planning,&nbsp;and related fields are encouraged to join us in imagining more just, adaptive, and
	ecologically aware&nbsp;approaches to engagement.</p>

<h2 id="ws-8">8. Framing and facilitating Participatory Design for Greater Impact (Half day, Sunday afternoon)</h2>
<p>Participatory design (PD) has the potential to address "big issues" with broad societal impact. This hybrid workshop
	will focus on two key themes: how we frame (distributed) PD activities, and how we facilitate (D)PD to support both
	participants and facilitators during the design process. These are unified by the question: How do we balance the
	desire for PD to have greater impact and tackle "big issues", while safeguarding the mental health of participants
	and facilitators?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants are invited but not required to submit a position paper.</p>

<h2 id="ws-9">9. Advancing Interdisciplinary Approaches to Online Safety Research (Full day, Sunday)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Addressing online safety effectively requires an interdisciplinary approach that bridges research,&nbsp;policy,
	design, and technology. Yet, current efforts across HCI often remain fragmented, with&nbsp;sub-fields tackling
	different aspects of the problem in isolation. This workshop brings together&nbsp;researchers, designers,
	policymakers, and industry practitioners to explore how online safety is&nbsp;approached across disciplines,
	identify current methods, gaps, and challenges, and foster new&nbsp;collaborations. Participants will work in
	interdisciplinary teams to develop shared understandings&nbsp;and co-create future research directions. We welcome
	those working on or interested in online&nbsp;safety across design, technology, policy, ethics, and the social
	sciences.</p>

<h2 id="ws-10">10. Empathic Entanglements: Designing with and for Robot Others (Full day, Sunday)&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This workshop explores how robots become expressive, empathic entities through amplified behaviours, animal-like
	movement, and textile augmentation. We frame robotic expression as more-than-human intelligence communicated through
	body, rhythm, and responsive materials. Participants will ask: How do we design for robotic acceptance without
	assuming sameness? How can machine behaviours evoke empathy without language? Using textile interfaces, such as
	elastic bands, feathers, and stretch fabric, participants will construct new connections between human and robot
	bodies. Outcomes, documented through short performance vignettes, will expand HRI design beyond functional or social
	robotics into speculative, somatic, and material empathy &ndash; interaction felt through contact, not commands.</p>

<h2 id="ws-11">11.&nbsp;Epistemic Injustice in and through AI (Full day, Sunday)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>AI is rapidly transforming knowledge production and practices across domains yet often embeds epistemic
	injustices&mdash;privileging dominant perspectives while marginalising others. This workshop&nbsp;critically
	examines epistemic injustice in AI through the lenses of generative AI, creative practice,&nbsp;healthcare, work,
	education, and automated decision-making. We explore how AI systems respond to diverse sociocultural and
	epistemological inputs, revealing systemic biases. Through collaborative&nbsp;mapping, creative experimentation, and
	critical reflection, participants will identify research priorities&nbsp;and intervention strategies. The workshop
	aims to foster rich dialogue, surface underrepresented&nbsp;perspectives, and advance research on epistemic justice
	in AI toward more inclusive, equitable&nbsp;technological futures.</p>
