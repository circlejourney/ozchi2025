<h1>Responsible Use of AI Tools in the Design Challenge</h1>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are now integrated into academic and professional practices. Responsible AI use means ensuring transparency and integrity in your work while selecting tools that align with your task's goals. It's crucial to critically review AI-generated content, verify its accuracy, and maintain your own voice in the final submission.</p>
<h2>Universal Principles for AI Tool Use</h2>
<p>Regardless of the specific task, your use of AI should be guided by these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be Transparent</strong>: You must clearly acknowledge and/or reference your use of any AI tools. This includes content that shaped your thinking, not just direct text. Transparency shows integrity and helps educators understand your process.</li>
<li><strong>Critically Review for Accuracy, Ethics, and Quality</strong>: Never accept AI outputs (text, images, etc) at face value. You are accountable for critically reviewing all content produced by an AI tool for accuracy, bias, and relevance. Ensure your final work reflects your own judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Your Own Voice and Thinking</strong>: While AI can help express ideas, your final work must showcase your unique judgment, reasoning, and creativity. The value of using AI lies in how you engage with it, not what it generates. Treat AI tools as a dialogue partner, but always shape the outcome yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your Reflective Acknowledgment</h2>
<p>For this challenge, you are required to submit a reflective acknowledgment. This is not just a list of the tools you used; it's a demonstration of how your decisions aligned with the principles of responsible AI use.</p>
<p><em>What to Include in Your Reflection:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview of Usage</strong>: Start with a summary of how you used AI tools. You can use a short table to show the tool, its purpose, a summary of your prompt or action, and the section of your work it affected.</li>
<li><strong>Context and Purpose</strong>: Briefly explain what you were trying to achieve with the help of AI tools or what guided your decision not to use them.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Decision-Making</strong>: Explain how you stayed in control of the process by critically evaluating the AI's output. Your reflection should show that you reviewed AI tool outputs thoughtfully, checking for clarity, accuracy, relevance, and logical quality. For example, did you consider if the AI's suggestion was too shallow or if it lacked a necessary perspective? Did you ensure the logic held together without contradictions? Did you identify and correct for any biases in the output?</li>
<li><strong>Ownership</strong>: Demonstrate how your final submission reflects your own authorship. Make it clear that your ideas, analysis, and final outputs are your own. You should explain how you revised, adapted, or rejected AI tool suggestions thoughtfully, making your thinking and reasoning visible in the final output.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution and Final Statement</strong>: Close your acknowledgment by clearly stating how you used the tools and affirm your ownership of the final work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>If You Choose Not to Use AI Tools</h2>
<p>You do not have to use AI tools in this challenge. If you choose not to, you should include a clear statement to this effect.</p>
