<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Welcome Event will be held at the Chau Chak Wing Museum, located at the University of Sydney&rsquo;s Camperdown Campus. Set amidst the sandstone heritage of the Great Hall and Quadrangle lawns, the museum provides a fitting venue to bring the OzCHI community together, reconnect, exchange ideas, and spark new conversations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us for an evening of drinks and canap&eacute;s surrounded by collections that span cultures and histories, from ancient civilisations to contemporary art and First Nations works. The Chau Chak Wing Museum embodies cultural and artistic creativity, making it an ideal setting to begin a week of dialogue, discovery, and connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entrance to the Museum is located on University Place, directly across from the Great Hall and Quadrangle lawns, adjacent to Fisher Library. The building sits at the University Avenue campus entrance, off Parramatta Road, near Baxter&rsquo;s Lodge and the historic gates. Scenic Victoria Park and Broadway are just a minute&rsquo;s walk away.</span></p>
