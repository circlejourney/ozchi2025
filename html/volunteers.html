<h1>Student Volunteers</h1>
<p>We are currently looking for student volunteers who will help the conference organisers run OzCHI 2025. The conference will be held at The University of Sydney from 29 November to 3 December 2025.</p>
<h2>Who Can Apply</h2>
<p>We are looking for enthusiastic, motivated, and reliable students who can confidently get the job done while enjoying and interacting professionally with delegates. No prior experience is required&mdash;this is a great opportunity to gain valuable experience in a professional conference setting. If you have previously volunteered for OzCHI, another conference, or similar events, your experience will be valued.</p>
<p>We welcome students from all disciplines and aim for a diverse mix of volunteers from universities across Australia and internationally. If you're keen to be part of an exciting academic event, we encourage you to apply!</p>
<h2>Responsibility and Benefits</h2>
<p>As a volunteer, you will work as a team with other volunteers to support the committee in running the conference and at the same time you will learn the latest in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. There will be the facility to organise the roster to provide you the opportunity to attend some of the conference sessions. In return for your collaboration, we offer free registration to the main conference, including the welcome reception and the conference dinner.</p>
