<h1>Demonstrations</h1>
<p>Demonstrations are contributions that allow researchers to present interactive experiences or technologies in a hands-on way for OzCHI conference attendees. Your demonstration can be an interactive experience, an interesting prototype, an art performance, or a novel system&ndash;or a combination of the above! We encourage submissions from any area of human-computer interaction, games, design, digital and interactive art, and entertainment.</p>
<h4>On-Site Details</h4>
<p>Demonstrations at OzCHI 2025 are planned as fully in-person. We ask authors who would like to present a demonstration at the conference to detail their envisioned setup in the paper submission. The organisers will provide you with a standard table, WiFi, and electrical outlets. Demonstrations will be presented alongside posters in dedicated time slots throughout the conference.</p>
